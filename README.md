# 🚀 AI Repo Explainer

AI Repo Explainer is a simple full-stack application that fetches GitHub repository data and generates a readable summary using API integrations and AI.

The goal of this project was to gain practical experience with:

- API integration
- Backend → External API communication
- SDK usage
- Frontend ↔ Backend data flow

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters a GitHub repository URL.
2. Backend extracts repository details using the GitHub REST API.
3. Repository data is processed on the server.
4. AI SDK generates a simple explanation of the repository.
5. The summary is displayed on the frontend.
